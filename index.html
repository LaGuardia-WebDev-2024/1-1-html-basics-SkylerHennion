    <h1>Poem about stuff</h1>

    <h2>copied from the internet :O</h2>

    <p>
     
I pondered long and deep<br>
About words to set in motion<br>
But as my pen took its leap<br>
I found a curious notion<br>

This poem, <em>I did not write</em><br>
Its words are not my own<br>
Yet still, they dance in light<br>
In a <em><strong>melody</strong></em> unknown.<br>
<br>
It speaks of a different way<br>
Of seeing the world around<br>
A perspective caught in play<br>
In a realm profound<br>
<br>
Perhaps it comes from above<br>
A gift from the <strong>divine</strong><br>
A message of love<br>
In every line<br>
<br>
I may not have penned it<br>
But I feel its <em>essence true</em><br>
In every word, every bit<br>
I find a piece of you<br>
<br>
So I'll embrace this unwritten verse<br>
With an open <strong>heart</strong> and <strong>mind<br></strong>
For in its beauty I immerse<br>
A treasure rare to find<br>
<br>
Ode to the unwritten poem<br>
I thank you for your presence<br>
In your <em>mystery</em>, I find <strong>home</strong><br>
In your <em>words</em>, I find <strong>essence</strong>.<br>
