<h1>
  Poem about stuff
  </h1>
  
  <h2>
    copied from the internet :O
  </h2>
  
  <p>
    
   I didn't write this poem, it's true <br>
But I'm here to share some wisdom with you<br>
Sometimes we don't have all the answers<br>
But that's okay, we're all just dancers  <br>

<br>Life can be tough, we all know<br>
But don't be afraid, let your light show<br>
It's okay to ask for help along the way<br>
Together we can make it through each day<br>
<br>
Don't be afraid to speak your mind<br>
Your voice matters, it's one of a kind<br>
We're all in this together, hand in hand<br>
Let's support each other, make a stand<br>
<br>
So even though I didn't write this verse<br>

I hope it helps, for better or worse <br>
Remember, you're never alone in this fight<br>
Together we'll make everything right.<br>
</p>
